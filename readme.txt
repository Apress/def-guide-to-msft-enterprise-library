Every Chapter contains a solution that has the code needed for that chapter.
In chapters where there is testable code run the ACME.POS.Service.Client project.
This project will contain simple buttons for testing the code so you can step through it.

The DB Scripts folder contains the script needed for creating the ACMEDb database.

Some chapters will contain a readme.txt file that may have special instructions for that chapter.

If you have any issues with the source code please, write me at my blog : http://blogs.msdn.com/knewton

I tried to make sure that this code will work on the majority of environments, but I can't guarantee all.
